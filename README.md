[Ignition](https://flareapp.io/docs/ignition-for-laravel/introduction) is a beautiful and customizable error page for Themosis applications. It is the default error page for new Themosis applications. It also allows to publicly share your errors on [Flare](https://flareapp.io). If configured with a valid Flare API key, your errors in production applications will be tracked, and you'll get notified when they happen.

`amphibee/themosis-ignition` works for Themosis applications running on PHP 8.0 and above.
